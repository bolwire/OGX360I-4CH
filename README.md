This project builds on the original OGX360 by Ryzee119: https://github.com/Ryzee119/ogx360/

The information provided in this repo is for informational purposes only.

The ATMEGA32U4 chips will need to be programmed with the arduino bootloader before they are put on the PCB. One option may be to remove the chips
from an arduino and transplant them.

Please respect the license files found within this project. What we do, and the joy we gain from that would not be possible without those who shared the
information with us to start with. Please respect and honor that by doing the same with any works derived from this or other projects linked to in this repo.

Also my spelling sucks, so I apologize for any type-ohs that exist.
